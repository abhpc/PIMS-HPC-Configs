## Uncomment the following "if block" when you have some buggy PXE NIC card (such as annoying sis900 NIC). Remember to modify the MAC vendor prefix and restart dhcpd service!!!
## This is a workround for some network card with BAD PXE code in firmware.
## It will only affect those clients with MAC vendor prefix you assigned.

# This class 'DRBL-Client' defines 3 kind of clients: PXE, Etherboot (1st stage) or DRBL client (2nd stage, i.e. in network initrd/initramfs (mkpxeinitrd-net)) to lease IP address.  This will only affect 'range' statement only, not the 'host' statement.
# Note! The following line(s) in the pool statement: 'allow members of "DRBL-Client";' is/are commented to disable this mechanism by default.
# If you do want to use this mechanism, uncomment all 'allow members of "DRBL-Client";', then only PXE, etherboot and DRBL client can lease IP address from this DHCP service.
# ///NOTE/// In summary, two cases you can turn on this mechanism:
# (1) This DRBL server is not used as a clonezilla server.
# (2) This DRBL server is used as a Clonezilla server, with the following conditions:
#     (a) 'range' statement is used in this DRBL service.
#     (b) There is an existing DHCP service which can provide IP address leases to the restored OS (either GNU/inux or MS Windows) in the client. Otherwise if you uncomment 'allow members of "DRBL-Client";', restored OS won't be able to lease IP address.
